### Improving Usability of Snow Data Through Web-based Visualizations and Tutorials
An open source workflow for processing and visualizing data from the [Snow Today](https://nsidc.org/reports/snow-today) research team. 

## Purpose

Scientists at the [UCSB Earth Research Institute](https://www.eri.ucsb.edu/) help communicate remotely sensed snow conditions through the Snow Today website, which presents daily images and monthly updates of snow variables, such as snow cover and albedo. The data used to generate these insights are available on the website, but since the analysis is completed with Matlab, a proprietary computational software system, the workflow does not follow open-source data practices. Remotely sensed snow data provides valuable information, but technical expertise can be a barrier to extracting meaningful insights from this data. This Capstone project addresses these limitations by creating an open-source workflow that improves the usability of snow data through interactive web-based visualizations and Python-based tutorials. As the impacts of climate change continue to affect snow conditions, the improved usability of Snow Today‚Äôs datasets allows for customized analyses of snow data for specific regions of interest to support decision making for water supply allocation, hydrologic research, and recreational planning.

## Organization Details

Four public repositories form the foundation of the Snow Today GitHub organization and Capstone project. The [snow_today_shiny_app](https://github.com/MEDSsnowtoday/snow_today_shiny_app) repository host the web application developed to showcase our project's interactive visualization deliverables. [Tutorials](https://github.com/MEDSsnowtoday/Tutorials) contains three Python notebooks that aid snow data users in downloading, accessing, processing, and visualizing the [National Snow and Ice Data Center's (NSIDC) Snow Today](https://nsidc.org/reports/snow-today)  snow cover and albedo datasets. The third repository hosts our project's [technical documentation](https://github.com/MEDSsnowtoday/Technical_Documentation). The Technical Documentation provides a functional discussion of the Snow Today Capstone project‚Äôs objectives, solution design, products, testing, and user documentation. [Data processing](https://github.com/MEDSsnowtoday/data_processing) has python notebooks that create tacked geotiff files of snow cover percent and albedo for each water year.
